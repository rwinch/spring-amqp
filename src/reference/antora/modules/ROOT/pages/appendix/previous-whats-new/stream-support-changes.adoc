= Stream Support Changes

`RabbitStreamOperations` and `RabbitStreamTemplate` have been deprecated in favor of `RabbitStreamOperations2` and `RabbitStreamTemplate2` respectively; they return `CompletableFuture` instead of `ListenableFuture`.
See xref:stream.adoc[Using the RabbitMQ Stream Plugin] for more information.
